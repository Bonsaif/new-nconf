Release 1.3.1 (tbd)

FIXED   security issue: contents of the config directory were viewable. Added .htaccess file to prevent users from accessing .ini files etc.
FIXED   security issue: 2 vulnerabilities listed on exploit-db.com for version 1.3.0
FIXED   compatibility problems with Internet Explorer 8 (and earlier)
FIXED   compatibility issue with some Icinga versions: generating the config would fail if advanced-services were not assigned to either a host or hostgroup.
FIXED   issue when importing items that are linked to other items which contain special characters in their names (e.g. service 'C:\ Drive')
FIXED   bug in Nagios config importer where the first item was being skipped if there was a comment above it

ADDED   icon preview to the OS details page
ADDED   authentication configuration option LOG_REMOTE_IP_HISTORY
ADDED   php-mysql check with proper message on INSTALL.php when not having mysql support.
ADDED   sha1 password support for apache htpasswd files -> see "sha_raw" encryption mode
ADDED   new icons for the new navigation
ADDED   "Add new ..." on each overview page, to create new items

CHANGED the whole navigation bar
CHANGED the style of the title on all pages
CHANGED advanced-actions box
CHANGED default behavior of multi-modify from "overwrite existing" to "add additional" (only for attributes that allow multiple values)
CHANGED the pattern used to parse for SNMP TRAP services within the collector configuration: services ending on "*TRAP" (caps) will be removed.

Release 1.3.0 (2011-12-11)

FIXED   a bug with the $SUPERADMIN_GROUPS array (array couldn't be unset). Also, superadmin groups are now listed first in the 'contact_groups' attr,
        allowing users to place the '+' sign in the beginning (useful to control inheritance of contact_groups from templates).
FIXED   a bug with 'generate_config' causing an endless loop and 100% CPU load. Root cause was a faulty implementation of the
        macro replacement function. Fixed a second bug that prevented macros from being added to service parameters.
FIXED   ordering of checkcommands with empty 'default service name'
FIXED   attribute ordering. Modifying or creating new attributes will not cause duplicate order numbers any more.
        Order numbers will now be changed / re-arranged automatically.
FIXED   a bug in displaying static links like 'generate nagios config' in the last user menu box, instead of 'Basic Items'
FIXED   security issue with 'call_ajax.php' -> new file handler implemented ('call_file.php') which prevents breaking out of nconf directory structure
FIXED   'Reset'-button did not reset all input fields, now it will reload the page to do a real reset for all changed values
FIXED   multimodiy and multidelete: amount of selected items was limited, because of apache 'LimitRequestLine Directive'.
        This is fixed with a change from GET to POST.
FIXED   some bugs with the way the Nagios importer parses uncommented lines in the Nagios configuration files; added check for prepending '+' characters
        in attributes to be imported.
FIXED   the way history entries are added for created or cloned services. Also, changes from host to services via inheritance will be tracked in history.
FIXED   a bug when adding a service over a host's "service" view. All attributes (also invisible ones) and their predefined values are added correctly.
FIXED   a bug when modifying services where it was possible to change a service name to the same as an other on the same host.
FIXED   services created over "add service" (in the main menu), did not check if the servicename is already taken by an other service on the host.
FIXED   a bug with assign_* attributes when an item name ended with an underscore "_"
FIXED   crypt will now work as expected (CRYPT_SALT option not used anymore)

ADDED	new sample data based on original sample config files from Nagios 3.3.1
ADDED   NConf can now work with 'modules'
ADDED   completely new deployment module with many new features (SCP, rsync, HTTPs, local deployment)
ADDED   jQuery - most GUIs will now use jQuery and its functionality
ADDED   jQuery UI - most elements are designed with jQuery UI and use its theme-roller styles.
ADDED   option 'illegal_object_name_chars' to test nagios.cfg file which is used for syntax checking. This is to make sure that generated 
        configuration files containing illegal chars in object names cannot be deployed anymore.
ADDED   'link_bidirectional' flag to allow attributes of type 'assign_*' to be visible in both classes that are linked to eachother
ADDED   'class_type' attribute to ConfigClasses table to discern between 'global', 'monitor' and 'collector' classes
ADDED   basic DB check (should detect a corrupt NConf DB and inform accordingly)
ADDED   check for existing classes or attributes, to detect possible conflicts during an update
ADDED   a script which exports items in the NConf database in different formats ('bin/get_items.pl'). It is intended for debugging and export purposes. 
ADDED   'call_file.php' -> replacing 'call_ajax.php' (security issue); the new file also handles the new module-files
ADDED   'class: NConf_DEBUG' which helps to manage DEBUG, INFO, ERROR and CRITICAL warnings.
ADDED   'class: NConf_HTML' which helps to print DEBUG messages. It also stores some functions (templates) to allow generating HTML output.
ADDED   optional constant 'DEBUG_GENERATE' for debugging config generation proccess (loglevel 1-5)
ADDED   handle_item.php -> replacing the old add/modify/multimodify GUIs
ADDED   help button with info text on add/modify Attributes/Classes (administration part) (jQuery)
ADDED   new possible_value for attribute 'command_param_count'; it can now also handle 0 (zero) arguments. The GUI will not show any param input lines then.
ADDED   classes 'host-dependency' and 'service-dependency' including their attributes.
ADDED   NConf file check: checks critical files (and directories) for read/write -able and if files exists/are removed, otherwise a critical error is thrown
ADDED   "service_enabled" attribute for services. Setting it to "no" will prevent a service entry from being written to the configuration.
ADDED   "hostgroup_members", "servicegroup_members" and "contactgroup_members" attributes to their respective classes.
ADDED   "service_template" attribute to checkcommand class. This allows one to specify a service-template to be applied to all services using a command.
ADDED   "default_service_dependency" attributes to checkcommand class. This allows NConf to auto-create service-dependencies for services on the same host.
ADDED   "template inheritance" view on the detail page of hosts and services
ADDED   new history action named "edited". It shows which items were changed. This improves the usability and tracking of changes a lot.

ADDED   selecting a different checkcommand while adding a service will now update the default service parameters
ADDED   AD (Active Directory) authentication functionality
ADDED   locking mechanism for 'generate config'. User will be stopped and warned if there is someone else already generating.
ADDED   when adding/modifying service parameters on a service, NConf will automatically trim spaces in front/end of value. (preventing copy/paste failures)
ADDED   before applying inherited values from the host to its services, there is now a preview of attributes, which are going to be overwritten
ADDED   NConf will now check for updates and show an info message (only if the user belongs to the admin group and if the update check hasn't been disabled)
ADDED   progress bar to the generate_config process
ADDED   multimodify of an assign_many attribute (e.g. 'contact_groups') now shows a mode selection for how to apply the new values: 
        'overwrite' (as previously) or 'add' to append additional values.
ADDED   advanced-services which allow more liberty and can be assigned to multiple hosts and hostgroups
ADDED   syntax checking for static config folders. This functionality can be enabled/disabled using the new CHECK_STATIC_SYNTAX constant.
ADDED   script to append/link an additional contactgroup with existing hosts & services
ADDED   conversion script to make sure config is still generated the same way after an update to NConf 1.3 -> refer to the Release Notes!
ADDED   "first_notification_delay" attribute to the classes host, service, advanced-service, host-template and service-template
ADDED   functionality to keep generated config even if it doesn't pass the syntax check when debug mode is active (contributed by Yannick Charton)
ADDED   HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION, including 2 new constants AUTH_METHOD and BASICAUTH_REALM

REMOVED 'extended_host_info.cfg' and 'extended_service_info.cfg' files. The original contents of those files are now written to 'hosts.cfg' 
        and 'services.cfg' respectively. Also, those properties are now available both on Collector and Monitor servers.
REMOVED 'call_ajax.php' -> replaced with 'call_file.php'
REMOVED add_item.php -> implemented as handle_item.php
REMOVED modify_item.php -> implemented as handle_item.php

REMOVED include/js/ajax-dynamic-content.js -> functionality replaced with jQuery & jQuery UI
REMOVED the -n parameter for all import scripts. No more need to specify the naming attribute when running any of the import scripts.

MOVED   config.orig/main.php (config/main.php) -> moved to root NConf directory (nconf/)
MOVED   include/history_tab.php -> moved to tabs directory include/tabs/history.php
MOVED	5 attributes from timeperiods to hosts/services directly (max_check_attempts, notification_interval etc.) -> refer to the Release Notes!
MOVED	5 attributes from collectors/monitors to hosts/services directly (active_checks_enabled, notifications_enabled etc.) -> refer to the Release Notes!

CHANGED add host - step2 will now redirect directly to 'modify service', which will add services for each checkcommand linked to the cosen host-preset
CHANGED 'message'-function: INFO, DEBUG etc. are now handled over the new class (NConf_DEBUG). Old message function only forwards to new class.

Release 1.2.6 (2009-11-26)

FIXED    'permission denied' bug when a 'normal' user tries to clear a form
FIXED    'unknown' user bug in history entry when generating updated Nagios config
FIXED    max_length limit of 'address' field when cloning a host
FIXED    a bug within the input form for service parameters (proper handling of the '!' character)
FIXED    a problem with 'multi_modify' not enforcing ONCALL_GROUPS setting
FIXED    quotes bug " (double) and ' (single) in the Attributes -> Show / Add form for attributes of type 'select' 
         and in all other text fields (attribute & friendly name, description, possible values, pre-defined value)

ADDED    CSV importer and example scripts to import any type of items from a CSV file into NConf
ADDED    an ID-wrapper script (id_wrapper.php) that allows users to embed a link to the NConf 'details' page,
         knowing only the name of an item (item name and item class are passed as GET-parameters)
ADDED    configuration option OVERVIEW_QUANTITY_STANDARD
ADDED    configuration option SELECT_VALUE_SEPARATOR
ADDED    'host-template' class and attributes, added several predefined host-template items
ADDED    'service-template' class and attributes, added several predefined service-template items
ADDED    'use' attribute to 'hosts' & 'services' classes
ADDED    a new 'host_template' and 'service_template' attribute to timeperiods, nagios-collectors and nagios-monitors. This allows users to 
         specify templates to be auto-assigned to each service which is linked with these items.
ADDED    'default_service_name' attribute to checkcommand class. This value will be used when adding new services instead of the checkcommand name.
ADDED    'notes' and 'notes_url' attributes to hostgroup and servicegroup classes.
ADDED    'stale_service_command' attribute to 'nagios-monitor' class. If set, this writes a 'dummy' check_command to all services on a 'nagios-monitor.
         The 'dummy' check_command is therefore no longer triggered by the 'active_checks_enabled' flag.
ADDED    new datatype 'assign_cust_order' to ConfigAttrs table and GUIs. This allows users to specify the order of how linked items 
         should be written to the config (necessary for 'use' attributes to define order of templates).

CHANGED  'generate config': added possibility to use %...% style NConf macros in any text attribute (e.g. %NAGIOS_SERVER_NAME% etc.)
CHANGED  'generate config': added 'check_result_path' = nconf/temp/ to temp/test/nagios.cfg for syntax checking. This eliminates 
         the common error 'Unable to write to check_result_path'.
CHANGED  ConfigAttrs.link_as_child attribute in the database to ENUM('yes','no') NOT NULL default 'no'
CHANGED  several host, service, timeperiod, nagios-collector and nagios-monitor attributes from 'mandatory' to 'not mandatory'
